    <h3><u>My I-Search</u></h3>
    <p class="p">In my 9th grade English class we did I-Search projects. My topic for my project was how the covid pandemic was affecting the mental heath of teenagers. This project took a lot of time and hard work to get done. I had to write many papers to put them all into the final product. I had to do research, watch movies and reivew them, read books, and interview people. All of those I had to write papers with the information I got. The stress I felt was constant with this project but the final product made me proud. When I finally turned it in I could say I was shocked how well it came together. The picture below shows the title page of my I-Search.

    <h3><u>APCSP Performance Task</u></h3>
    <p class="p">A part of the AP Computer Science Principles class AP test was to code a project and do a write up and video on it. I did a code that asked you if you want to learn about flowers and then continued to ask what kind of flower. The user would type in what kind of flower they wanted to know more about then a picture of the flower and a fact about it would show up on the screen. I had to code the entire project. Then answer a lot of questions about my code and also make a short video of me using it. This took a lot of time and trouble shooting to make this work. Coding the project was fun and I really enjoyed doing it. The writing was harder to answer because I had to explain a lot of things in my code. I learned how to code a big project and make it work by myself. The picture below shows my performance task project.</p>
