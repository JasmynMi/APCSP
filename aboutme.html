    <p class="p">My name is Jasmyn. I like to run track and field. I really enjoy the community and people I meet in the team. I enjoy learning how to do new events and improve on them. Running has always been a fun thing for me since middle school. It is hard but I do like it.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I like reading and hanging out with my family. I like being at my house. I like alot of different genres of books. I have tried to read a varity to know what I like.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I like eating waffles and crepes. Making crepes in the morning with fresh berrys and whipped cream is great. I also just like to bake and cook things. I like making food for other people. It makes me happy when they like my food. The picture to the left shows strawberry shortcake I made in the past for my family.</p>
